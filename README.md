Hello!

To successfully run this project locally please follow the instructions below:

1. You will need to create two .env files in the root directory
2. The first new file should be to run the test database - env.test
3. The second new file should be to run the development database - env.development
4. Within each file there should be one line of code - PGDATABASE=database_name_here
5. Please contact me and I will send over the database names. 
6. When both files are ready, please add them to the .gitignore.
7. You may now run the project locally!
